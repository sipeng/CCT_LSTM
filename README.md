# CCT_LSTM

A Hierarchical LSTM Model for CCT Churn Prediction (Group behaviors)

- Python 3.5.2
- Keras 2.0.3
- Tensorflow 1.0.1

## Hierarchical LSTM model v.s. Baseline models

The baseline models I use are:
- Single LSTM model: build a contract (group) level LSTM model only
- Neural Network: fully-connected neural network (MLP)
- Logistic Regression
